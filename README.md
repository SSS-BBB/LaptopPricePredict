# Laptop Price Prediction Program

## About
This project, I used Python to create a prediction model for laptop price and server to use this model. And I use Java to create a program that the user will use to input a laptop property. The program will send datas to the server. The server will send the datas to the model that was created. The model will estimates the price of the laptop given the datas that it got. Then the server will send the estimated price to the program, and the program will show user the estimated price for this laptop.
